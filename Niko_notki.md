Himara Seas The Day!

We are a local company based in Himare, Albania. We have over 10 years of experience in organizing boat tours to the famous Grama Bay, Gjipe Beach and the amazing sea caves found in the area nearby. Our fleet consists of 3 boats that meet and exceed all safety regulations and are operated by experienced local captains and personnel. We speak English, Albanian and Greek. 




Grama Bay Tour DAILY TRIP

Grammata Beach is located at the foot of the western slope of Karaburun Peninsula, in the Bay of Grama, which has long served as place of refuge for ships fleeing storms. In ancient times, this bay was used for stone quarrying, traces of which are still visible in the form of dramatic cliffs. “Grammata” comes from the Greek world for “letters” (which is also the source of the word “grammar”). This is no coincidence, as ancient sailors and quarry workers have left thousands of inscriptions with their names.

Trip details

The boat departs from the small pier in the centre of Himare to Grama Bay every day. It takes approximately 2-2.5 hours to reach the destination. Along the way, you can stop for photos and swimming in the beautiful local blue caves and bays between Himara and Grammata Beach, including Pigeon's Cave, Gjipe Beach, Pirate's Cave, Drymades beach, Palasa beach, the Thunder Cave, and the unique Saint Andreas bay. We typically spend around 1-1.5 hours at Grama, and the return trip to Himara takes about 1 hour.

The total duration of the trip is around 5 hours with 4 stops for swimming and many stops for photos!
Price 6000 ALL/person 

Important info 
The meeting point is at our stand on the Himara main beach called “Himara Seas The Day” boat trips.

I'm creating a website for advertising my business: in Himara (a coastal town in Albania) I organize boat trips for tourists and I also let tourists my apartments. 70% of my income is from boat trips, 30% from apartment rentals. Help me add relevant values to "content" properties and check the head tag for errors.


Include information about the boat trips that you offer, such as the duration, destinations, and activities that are included. You can also mention the types of boats you have and their capacities. Make sure to emphasize the safety features of your boats. 

Provide details about the apartments that you offer, such as the number of rooms, amenities, and location. You can also mention the views and the proximity to the beach or other attractions. Make sure to highlight the cleanliness and comfort of the apartments. 

Mention the prices for your boat trips and apartment rentals, as well as any special offers or discounts that you have. 

Use relevant keywords in your content and metadata to improve the visibility of your website in search engine results. Some examples of relevant keywords for your business may include "Himara boat trips," "Himara apartments," "Albanian coast," "Himara snorkeling tours," and "Himara fishing trips."

I'm creating a very simple layout: landing page with MENU (4 sections of MENU). Does every section have to be a linked to a separate page, or can I simply create 4 divs and manipulate their display when MENU section is clicked?
