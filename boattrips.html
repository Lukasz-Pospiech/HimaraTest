            <h1>Grama Bay</h1>
            <p class='smallLetters'>DAILY BOAT TRIP</p>
            <img src="grama1.jpg" alt="" class="tripDetailsPic">
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p> Grammata Beach is located at the foot of the western slope of Karaburun Peninsula, in the Bay of Grama, which has long served as place of refuge for ships fleeing storms. In ancient times, this bay was used for stone quarrying, traces of which are still visible in the form of dramatic cliffs. “Grammata” comes from the Greek world for “letters” (which is also the source of the word “grammar”). This is no coincidence, as ancient sailors and quarry workers have left thousands of inscriptions with their names.</p>
            <img src="grama2.jpg" alt="" class="tripDetailsPic">

We typically spend around 1-1.5 hours at Grama, and the return trip to Himara takes about 1 hour.</p>
